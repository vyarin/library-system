# An Overly Complicated Library System

This is my final project I made for my introductory computer science course in summer school. For reasons most likely to students plagiarizing their final projects, there was very little creative liberty to this assignment. But anyway, we had to all make a library system!

## Requirements for the program

- Use input and output
- Use variables, conditions and loops
- Use methods

## Why the sorting algorithms?

'Cause I could (and I learned a bit along the way!)
This kind of backfired though, as the time it took to sort my data took quite a while, since insertion sort was not the best at such large amounts of data I tested with. So, my system was much more inefficient at first. After the sorting was done though, it worked pretty well!

This was completely unnecessary, however, since I do not believe the teacher would have the time to insert 60,000 books into the program *manually* (there was no way to add books in bulk) with the time that he had to mark this...

## How about using objects?

Out of the scope of the course, so we could not use it for this assignment.
